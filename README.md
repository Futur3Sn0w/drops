# Pinboard - The Material You Dashboard
Pinboard is a web interface for creating widgets (or Pins) that can be placed anywhere on screen. Pins can have online information, notes, links, images, and much more.
It mimicks the Material You user interface seen in the latest Android 12 and Android 13 versions, allowing for personalization and customization of elements to make the page truly feel unique to you.

The idea behind Pinboard is to make it easy to create glancable pieces of information that you can change and update on the fly. Throughout your day, you can refer back to it with notes and ideas, links to read later, or to just check the weather.

With Pinboard, everything you do is saved automatically, so you don't have to worry about saving your work. Once you add a pin to your Pinboard, it's automatically saved for the next time you visit!

## Hey look, a person...
Pinboard is still in the (very) early stages. It works well right now for creating notes, but that's about it. The ultimate goal is to build it out into a web app with interactable widgets, a repository for adding widgets made by web developers, and more.

Currently, there are a few cool things to check out, which is why I went ahead and added this now haha.

### Pinboard? Check.
Pinboard is open and available for testing, but it does have some bugs, and many planned features haven't yet been added. However, as of version v0.7.0, it's finally in a state of proper usability, as it actually has a function (albeit, rather limited).<br>
That being said, Pinboard will continue to change and evolve, and your pins will update right along with the site. Anything you add will stay throughout the betas, and into public release.

### Changelog? Check.
Mainly for documentation purposes, there is an update/changelog available. If you want to see what's new in each update to the site, you can check it out here: 
https://github.com/Futur3Sn0w/drops/wiki/Updates

### To-Do? Check.
Similar to the above, you can check out the to-do list which includes a handful of features, additions, and changes that will be made to the site. You can also get a sneak peek at ideas that could be experimented with in the future! Check that out here:

### Widget Template? Almost...
For the web developers in the audience, a template for creating and adding information-rich and interactive widgets will be available in the future. Due to the earliness of Pinboard, the template will still be a little ways out, but if you'd like to get an early preview, I recommend keeping an eye out on Twitter. ;)
